|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Basics`       | Basics                 | First steps with the language. Getting familiar with the syntaxis and structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Project_1`    | OOP                    | This project demonstrates how to define classes, create objects, and implement core OOP concepts like inheritance.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Project_2`    | Simple FastAPI example | Get started with FastAPI. This project introduces the basics of building fast and efficient APIs using the FastAPI framework.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Project_3`    | OOP FastAPI example    | This project combines the power of Object-Oriented Programming with FastAPI.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Project_4`    | Fastapi example        | Building upon the previous FastAPI examples, this project explores more advanced features of the framework. Expect to see examples of request body validation with Pydantic, path and query parameters, error handling, and potentially an introduction to dependency injection. |
